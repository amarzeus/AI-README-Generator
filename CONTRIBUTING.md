When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

-   The expected behavior and what actually happened.

### üíª Pull Request Process

Ready to contribute some code? Here‚Äôs how to set up your fork and submit a pull request.

1.  **Fork the repository** by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the main repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2.  **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-github-readme-generator.git
    cd ai-github-readme-generator
    ```

3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes. Choose a descriptive branch name.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```

4.  **Make your changes** to the code. Ensure your code follows the existing style and conventions.

5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and concise commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add some amazing feature"
    ```
    We loosely follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

6.  **Push your changes** to your forked repository on GitHub.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature
    ```

7.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    - Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you have made.
    - Reference any relevant issues in your pull request description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## üé® Style Guides

-   **Git Commit Messages**: Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature"). Try to start your commit message with a relevant type, such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, or `chore`.
-   **TypeScript & React**: We follow standard conventions for TypeScript and React. Please ensure your code is well-formatted and readable. Run any linters or formatters if they are configured in the project.

We look forward to your contributions! üéâ
